India lives in its villages and inclusive development of people in villages, particularly the poor communities, will be critical if we want a better human development and nation’s prosperity. However, due to lack of education, information and communication interfaces, most of the poor communities either in rural or urban, are not aware of the available means for addressing their problems.Hence, by creating an adequate awareness among the communities, we can help to empower them to participate in the nation building.Awarenessbuilding activities are required to ensure that communities aremobilized as participants in the process of resolving the problems and development and connect their presence with the local, national and global platforms.

Whereas empowerment is the degree of autonomy and self-determination in people and communities. This enables them to represent their interests in a responsible and self-determined way, acting on their own authority to become economic independent and for social equality and justice.

PARD INDIA,since its commencement of services in January 2011, has been working for the development of poor children (V-kids) and their marginalized communities living in rural areas, through various initiatives under “Community Awareness & Empowerment Program”. We continuously making our presence to ensure collective participation of the local communities particularly the youth and the marginalized people by educating and empowering them for achieving inclusive development at grassroots.</p>
