<p>A transportation management system (TMS) is a logistics platform that uses technology to help businesses plan, execute, and optimize the physical movement of goods, both incoming and outgoing, and making sure the shipment is compliant, proper documentation is available. This kind of system is often part of a larger supply chain management (SCM) system.</p>

<h4>Transportation management and the supply chain</h4>
<p>In addition to transportation management, other components of a typical SCM system include procurement, product lifecycle management, supply chain planning, order management, manufacturing, inventory, and warehouse management.  </p>

<h4>Why it is important to have a transportation management system</h4>
<p>Transportation management systems play a central role in supply chains, affecting every part of the processâ€”from planning and procurement to logistics and lifecycle management. The broad and deep visibility afforded by a powerful system leads to more efficient transportation planning and execution, which results in higher customer satisfaction. That, in turn, leads to more sales, helping businesses grow. With such a dynamic global trade environment that we live and transact in, it is important to have a system that will allow you to successfully navigate complicated processes around trade policies and compliance. </p>

<h4>Who Uses a TMS?</h4>

<p>Transportation management systems are primarily used by businesses that need to ship, move, and receive goods on a regular basis, including:</p>

<h4>The future of TMS</h4>

<p>Customer expectations keep rising, not only for on-time deliveries but for two-day and even same-day deliveries, with real-time updates provided throughout the shipment process. Ever-changing global trade regulations are also forcing supply chains to innovate to keep pace, often by investing in a transportation management system.</p>
