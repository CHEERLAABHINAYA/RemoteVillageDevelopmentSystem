<p>Water campaigns usually address a particular issue, which is relevant to the community. The message of a campaign should be clear and simple, associated with a logo or a consistent image. In order to reach maximum effect, a campaign should be sustained over time. Choices need to be made regarding the reach of the campaign, the target group, the desired change in perception and/or behaviour, and the likely influence of the target group on the campaign outcomes. Involving a campaign specialist who has experience in managing similar programmes can improve the success rate of a campaign. Campaigns can use a number of communication methods such as</p><br>


    <ul><li>Direct use of conventional media (printed media, TV, radio) and/or non-conventional media (messages on water bills, games, transport tickets, comic books, etc.), through the visual and performing arts;</ul></li>
    <ul><li>Organization of large events and/or endorsement by celebrities (generating media attention);</ul></li>
    <ul><li>Use of existing networks (religious networks, social movements, NGO networks, business associations);</ul></li>
    <ul><li>Use of logos (e.g. a water drop) to give identity to the campaign.</ul></li><br>


<p>Public access to information has been powerful in raising environmental awareness. Examples include the Toxic Release Inventory in the US where companies are required to publish a list of all their toxic emissions, which can then be used in campaigns by NGOs and lobby groups. In the water domain, a requirement to publish information can be a powerful reinforcement of other policy tools such as pollution charges. Corporate Social Responsibility reporting is another mechanism for raising awareness, encouraging companies and institutions to report their social and environmental performance. This also promotes environmental Stewardship.</p><br>
