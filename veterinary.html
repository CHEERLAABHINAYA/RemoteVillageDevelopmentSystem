<p>Historically, veterinary managers evolved when veterinary owners realized they were not qualified or did not have the time to handle the multitude of business-related responsibilities in the veterinary hospital. Although the Veterinary Hospital Managers Association (VMHA) was initiated 25 years ago, only in the past 10 to 15 years has the positive financial impact of veterinary managers been realized and subsequently incorporated into the management level of some veterinary hospitals. The VHMA has been certifying managers with the College of Veterinary Practice Managers (CVPM) designation since 1992. Many of these original veterinary managers started as part-time employees with a single mandate to “manage the staff ” or “do the bookwork.”</p>
